# Communal-lie-detector
An installation to promote sustainable policy with regards to the UK government's proposed northern powerhouse. 

A voltage divider is made between a fixed resistor and a chain of humans holding hands (via some copper "probes" held at either end of the human chain). 
An arduino reads the voltage at the middle of the divider and uses it to determin the colour of a string of WS2801 RGB l.e.d.s. Some (badly coded) smoothing makes the colours change slowly.
